            <p>Color Scheme: In this graph, blue represents the small forwards and brown represents the guards. 
                On a basketball court, the key, or area closest to the basket, is typically painted blue
            while the rest of the court is just the brown wood. Since small forwards typically pay closer
        to the basket, their color is blue. Since guards typically play further from the bakset outside of the key,
    their color is brown (for the wood).</p>
            <p>Marks and Channels: The marks are the points, where each point represents a player in a given season.
                The channels used are the horizontal and vertical positions and color. The horizontal position encodes
                the NBA season and the vertical position encodes the average 3 point attempts per game in a given season.
                The color represents which position the player plays, blue for small forwards or brown for guards.

            <p>Color Scheme: In this graph, blue represents the defensive rebounds and red represents the offensive rebounds.
                This color scheme was chosen mainly so that it's easy to distinguish between each type of rebound. For example, 
                orange and red weren't chosen because those colors are fairly similar. Blue and red are easy to distinguish and
                happen to be the colors of the NBA logo, so they also fit the topic. Lastly, I chose red for offensive
                rebounds because red sticks out more and garnering offensive rebounds is often harder. The red color draws more attention to this.

            <p>Marks and Channels: The mark for this plot is lines. The lines form the bars that represent the data for that season. 
                The channels include horizontal position, vertical position, and color. The vertical position represents the number of 
                rebounds, and the horizontal position indicates the season. The color tells you the type of rebound
                and helps visualize how much of the total rebounds is offensive rebounds and what portion is defensive rebounds.

            <p>Color Scheme: In this graph, a blue-green color scheme is used. This color scheme's  transition from light green hues
                to dark blues makes it easy to distinguish states with high values (dark blue) and states with lower values (light green).
                Also, this color scheme is nice because the generally darker hues represent the largest values, the medium blue hues
                represent the medium/more typical values, and the light hues represent the very low values. All in all, I believe this color 
                scheme has nice distinct colors making it easy to distinguish (as opposed to a simple gradient color scheme), so that's why it
                was chosen.

            <p>Marks and Channels: The mark for this plot is area. The different area marks in this choropleth map are the different states.
                The channel in this graph is color. The hue of the state represents the number of NBA players from that state. Darker hues 
                correspond to a greater number of NBA players from that state while lighter hues correspond to a lower number of NBA players.
